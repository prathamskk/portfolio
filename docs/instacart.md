## Instacart Reorder Classification

Objective: 

Predicts whether a previously purchased product will be reordered in a 
customer's next order

---

**1. Huge Dataset: 1.3 million orders, 50,000 products, 3.4 million past total orders**  

![Dataset Overview](instacart_dataset_description.png)

---

---

**2. Bananas are the most reordered product‚Äîeveryone loves bananas!**  

![Banana Popularity Chart](banana_pop_chart.png)

---

**3. Shopping peaks on weekends and between 10 AM‚Äì4 PM**  

![Order Timing Chart](order_timing_chart.png)

---

**4. Fresh fruits, vegetables, and dairy are the most frequently reordered aisles**  

![Top Aisles Chart](top_aisles_chart.png)

---

**5. Items added to the cart first are much more likely to be reordered**

---

**6. XGBoost model predicts reorders with 80% recall‚Äîvery few missed repeat buys**

---

**7. Feature engineering (user habits + product loyalty) boosted accuracy to 71%**  

![Feature Engineering Impact](instacart_optimized_xgboost.png)

---

**8. Neural network was slower and didn't beat XGBoost for this task**  

![Model Comparison](instacart_nn_xgboost.png)

---

**9. SHAP analysis: Product name, reorder history, and cart position are most important**  

![SHAP Feature Importance](instacart_shap.png)

---

**10. Model struggles most with "sometimes" products‚Äînot always or never reordered**

---

**Future Improvement**

* While XGBoost performed well, hyperparameter tuning could further improve performance. Techniques such as Bayesian optimization or grid search could refine learning rates, tree depth, and regularization parameters to enhance generalization.
* Threshold optimization may also help reduce misclassifications in borderline cases.
* Additionally, segmentation-based modeling, where separate models are trained for high-reorder and low-reorder products, could better capture different shopping behaviors.
