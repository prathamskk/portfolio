## Azure Data Lake and ETL Pipeline

### Project Overview

Honestly, this project was all about getting hands-on experience with Azure and learning core data engineering concepts and tools. I started by exploring the sample Adventure Works data available in Azure. Then, I set up an Azure SQL Database to store and manage the data.

Next, I created Azure Resource Groups to organize all my resources, and set up an Azure Storage Account with containers, leveraging ADLS Gen2 for scalable storage. I designed the data lake using the medallion architecture‚Äîso I had bronze, silver, and gold layers to structure the data as it moved through the pipeline.

I used Azure Data Factory (ADF) to orchestrate the ETL process. ADF moved the SQL tables from Adventure Works into the bronze containers folder in my data lake. Then, I brought in Databricks and Spark to handle the heavy lifting for data processing. I connected DBT (Data Build Tool) to Databricks, and in DBT, I built data marts and performed all the necessary data transformations.

The flow went like this:

1. **ADF** moved the raw data into the **bronze** layer (Parquet format).
2. **DBT with Databricks** performed transformations to combine and clean the data, storing the results in the **silver** layer (Delta format).
3. Analytics-ready data marts were created in the **gold** layer (Delta format), making the data ready for reporting and analysis.

Throughout, I worked with Parquet files for efficient storage and processing in the earlier stages, and Delta format for the silver and gold layers. Step by step, I got to see how all these tools fit together in a real-world data engineering workflow.
