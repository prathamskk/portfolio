Limitation

The dataset may be biased due to missing values excluded during data cleaning, caused by network errors and challenges in capturing JavaScript-rendered content. For instance, missing course-price data likely excluded free courses, skewing the dataset toward paid offerings. This cleaning reduced the dataset size from 19,425 to 8,148 observations, diminishing diversity and completeness. The smaller dataset increases the risk of overfitting as it is less likely to reflect the population, leading to the generalization problem accurately.

The dataset may also introduce potential bias due to omitted variables, resulting in biased and inconsistent estimates . Some potentially impactful variables, such as course ranking and elapsed time since launch were not included in the dataset and model. These key feature omissions could cause misattribution of effects and skew predictions. These omissions limit the model's ability to capture the complex factors influencing student decisions, potentially reducing its generalizability.
