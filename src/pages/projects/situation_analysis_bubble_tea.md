## Project Overview

For a UCL Marketing Analytics assignment, I conducted a **situation analysis** and outlined the **next steps in the marketing process** for a new bubble tea shop in Canary Wharf. The work applied the **5C's framework** (Company, Customers, Competitors, Collaborators, Context), then **Segmentation–Targeting–Positioning (STP)** and the **Marketing Mix (4P's)** to show how environmental and contextual factors shape marketing decisions.

## What I Did

### 1. Situation Analysis (5C's)

I structured the analysis around each C: what it means in general, how it applies to the bubble tea business, and how it would affect marketing decisions.

![5C's marketing framework](/projects/situation_analysis_bubble_tea/diagram_5cs.png)

| C | Focus | How it informed the plan |
|---|--------|---------------------------|
| **Company** | Internal factors, goals, capabilities | Aligned the offer with a quality-focused, variety-led positioning. |
| **Customers** | Who they are, where they are, what they want | Shaped targeting and product/experience design. |
| **Competitors** | Direct and indirect | Drove differentiation and positioning. |
| **Collaborators** | Partners and channels | Informed distribution and reach (delivery, B2B). |
| **Context** | Legal, social, environmental | Led to compliance, health/sustainability, and community angles. |

---

#### Company

- **In general:** The Company dimension covers internal factors—resources, goals, strengths, and constraints.
- **In this context:** The “company” was positioned as a quality-focused bubble tea shop that would use a genuine passion for the product to drive variety and ingredient standards.
- **Impact on marketing:** Emphasising **quality and variety** in messaging and product development; ensuring the brand promise matched what the shop could consistently deliver.

---

#### Customers

- **In general:** Customers are the people or segments the business serves; understanding them drives targeting and value proposition.
- **In this context:** Target customers included both food enthusiasts and casual drinkers—**young professionals**, **students**, and **local residents** around the shop, with a mix of walk-in and delivery.
- **Impact on marketing:** Designing a **customisable**, **quick** offer (flavours, toppings, formats) and tailoring promotions and channels to professionals and students (e.g. lunch, after-work, study breaks).

---

#### Competitors

**Direct competitors**

- Established bubble tea chains (e.g. YiFang, T4, Lucky Tea, Heytea, Chatime), each with a distinct position (e.g. traditional Taiwanese vs. trendy, social-media-led).
- **Impact:** Need for clear **differentiation** (e.g. quality, sustainability, local community, menu innovation) rather than competing on the same attributes.

**Indirect competitors**

- Other drinks and food outlets: **coffee** (Starbucks, Costa, Pret), **smoothies**, **juices**, and **iced teas** competing for the same occasion and spend.
- **Supermarkets** and convenience: packaged bubble tea and ready-to-drink options emphasising convenience over experience.
- **Impact:** Positioning had to stress **experience**, **customisation**, and **quality** to justify visiting the shop vs. grabbing a substitute elsewhere.

---

#### Collaborators

- **Delivery platforms (Uber Eats, Deliveroo, Just Eat):** Extend reach and cater to time-poor professionals in Canary Wharf; trade-off is **commission vs. volume**—needed to model whether delivery increases net contribution.
- **Local institutions (offices, UCL School of Management):** Bulk orders, student/office discounts, and community partnerships to build **repeat usage** and loyalty.
- **Impact on marketing:** Allocating budget and effort between **own channel** (footfall, loyalty) and **third-party delivery**; designing B2B and community offers as part of the mix.

---

#### Context

- **Legal/regulatory:** Food safety, hygiene, waste, and employment law—non‑negotiable for operations and positioning (e.g. “compliant, trustworthy”).
- **Social:** Demand for **healthier** options (e.g. reduced sugar, organic) and support for **local** businesses—used to shape product (e.g. low-sugar, organic lines) and storytelling.
- **Environmental:** Preference for **sustainability** (e.g. biodegradable cups/straws, reusable cups, responsible sourcing)—used to position the brand and justify premium or ethical choices.

---

### 2. Next Steps in the Marketing Process

After the situation analysis, I outlined the remaining major steps: **strategy (STP)**, **tactics (4P's)**, and **objectives**.

![STP: Segmentation, Targeting, Positioning](/projects/situation_analysis_bubble_tea/diagram_stp.png)

---

#### Strategy (STP)

| Step | Application |
|------|-------------|
| **Segmentation** | By age, lifestyle, and preferences: e.g. young professionals, students, health-conscious consumers. |
| **Targeting** | Prioritise **office workers** and **bubble tea enthusiasts** nearby who value variety and healthier options. |
| **Positioning** | A **modern, eco-friendly** bubble tea brand with **high-quality ingredients** and **customisable** drinks. |

---

#### Tactics (4P's)

![Marketing Mix: 4P's](/projects/situation_analysis_bubble_tea/diagram_4ps.png)

| P | Plan |
|---|------|
| **Product** | Seasonal flavours, vegan options, customisable toppings to serve different segments. |
| **Price** | Tiered pricing: standard drinks plus premium options (e.g. organic or premium ingredients). |
| **Place** | High-footfall location in Canary Wharf; delivery via Uber Eats/Deliveroo to extend reach. |
| **Promotion** | Social media, influencer collaborations, and in-store promotions to build local awareness. |

---

#### Objectives

- **Margins:** Cost-effective sourcing and operations to protect profitability.
- **ROI:** Track and evaluate marketing spend (e.g. by channel/campaign) to improve efficiency.
- **Customer lifetime value (CLV):** Retention tactics (e.g. rewards programme) to increase repeat visits and loyalty.

## What I Learnt

- **5C's as a discipline:** Structuring the situation analysis by Company, Customers, Competitors, Collaborators, and Context forced a clear view of what the business can do, who it serves, who it’s up against, who it works with, and what rules and trends matter—before committing to strategy and tactics.
- **Direct vs. indirect competition:** Beyond bubble tea chains, coffee shops, smoothie bars, and supermarkets compete for the same occasion and wallet—positioning and messaging had to reflect that broader set of alternatives.
- **Collaborators as a lever:** Delivery platforms and local institutions aren’t just logistics; they shape reach, positioning, and economics—so partnership and channel choices are core marketing decisions.
- **Context into positioning:** Legal, social, and environmental factors aren’t only constraints; they became opportunities (health, sustainability, local community) to differentiate and build a coherent brand story.
- **From situation to strategy to tactics:** Doing the situation analysis first made STP and the 4P's more grounded—targeting, positioning, and the mix were explicitly tied to the 5C's findings rather than generic best practice.
